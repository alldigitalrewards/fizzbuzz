# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge

This is an entry level exercise that most of us have likely done before.  
The goal of this exercise is to see that you are familiar with git, your IDE, composer, and PHPUnit. 
  
1. Clone this repo
2. Install the composer dependencies
3. Run PHPUnit
4. Make the test pass.
